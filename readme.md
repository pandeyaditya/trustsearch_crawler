I have created the project using Laravel Framework and Bootstrap for styling. Here I tried exploring few API's and library to make it work.
Please find the below details.

1) I have created the project using the below library:

-> A PHP DOM Parser               
(https://github.com/paquettg/php-html-parser)

-> Symfony's HttpClient Component (https://symfony.com/doc/current/components/http_client.html)

2) I also tried using the TrustPilot's API, but it had authentication (paid version)

TrustPilot : https://developers.trustpilot.com  (Not free)
TrustedShop : https://api.trustedshops.com/documentation/public/

Steps to test the project.

-> Take git clone of the repo.
-> Run composer install
-> Run the php artisan key:generate command
